## Controlling your content

Harp brings you back to the basics of the web. Always keep in mind that your directory structure and file names are your URL paths.

Creating a new page is as simple as creating a new file and writing content in it.

### `public/posts`

This is where your posts and their content live.

### `public/_layout.jade`

The layout of your site, including header, footer and sidebar. External scripts or stylesheets are included in this file. Global elements belong here as well (i.e.: header, nav, sidebar, etc.)

### `public/index.jade`

This is the default page when you visit your domain (i.e.: `http://localhost:9966/`). Here we build the loop that goes through your posts and shows them in the front page.

### `public/assets/css/app.less`

This is the place where your blog CSS should live.

## Adding new posts

__1__. Create a new file (`.jade`, `.ejs`, `.html` or `.md`) in the `public/posts/` directory

````
$ touch public/posts/kittens.html
````

__2__. Enter your post content in the file you just created:

_public/posts/kittens.html:_

````
<h1><a href="/posts/kittens">I love kittens!</a></h1>
<p>This is my first post using Harp!</p>
````

__3__. Open `public/posts/_data.json` and add your new post data:

````
{
  ...                        <-- other blog posts
  "kittens": {               <-- post slug (file name without extension)
    "title": "Cute Kittens"  <-- post title
  }
  ...                        <-- other blog posts
}
````

## Adding new pages

__1__. Create a new file inside the `public` directory:

````
$ touch public/about.html
````

__2__. Enter the page content in the newly created file

_public/about.html:_

````
<h1>About me</h1>
<p>I love fotoshapz and taking pictures of foods</p>
````

__3__. Your can now access your page in your browser. I.e.: `http://localhost:9966/about`

## Migrating from a WordPress blog

If you’re planning to move your WordPress site to Harp, I’d recommend cloning it using wget or curl:

This one-line terminal command will create a static replica of __yourwebsite.com__ in your computer, it’ll fix all the links to work locally and download all the necessary assets (images, javascript, css and other files):

```
$ wget --recursive --no-clobber --page-requisites --html-extension --convert-links yourwebsite.com
```

## Enabling/Disabling Comments

This blog boilerplate makes it really easy to enable your visitors to leave comments on your blog posts.

Open the `/harp.json` file and look for the disqus section. It should look something like this:

```
...
"disqus": {
  "enabled": false,
  "shortname": ""
}
...
```

In the disqus configuration there are two configurable keys:

`enabled`: can be `true` or `false`. Make it true to display comments and false to disable them. Make sure the value is not wrapped in quotes like this `"false"`, otherwise it will still show the comments.

`shortname`: this is your shortname assigned by Disqus. [Signup for Disqus](https://disqus.com/admin/signup/) and get your own shortname, then enter it as a string (with wrapping double quotes) as the shortname value.

This is what it looks like when it’s enabled:

```
...
"disqus": {
  "enabled": true,
  "shortname": "jorgepedret"
}
...
```
